# Web Toaster

A simple app that listens for HTTP requests and converts them to Windows toast notifications.

## Example Usage Scenario

VOIP phones such as the Yealink T46G can call URLs when certain actions take place. These actions include when there is an incoming call, a call is missed, or the microphone is muted. Configure the phone to make different requests to show notifications in Windows.
